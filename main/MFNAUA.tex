\section{Multilayer Feedforward Networks are Universal Approximators}

In 1988 Maxwell Stinchcombe and Halber White show that Multilayer
Feedforward Networks with one hidden layer are Universal Approximators.  

The proof is based on that arbitrary squashing function are capable of approximating
any Borel measurable function from one finite dimensional space to another to any desired 
degree of accuracy, provided sufficiently hidden units are available. In this sense 
Feedforward networks are a class of Universal approximators.

Firstly we are going to start with some basic definitions. 

\begin{definition}Affine functions  

    Affine functions are defined as all the 
    function of the form $A(x) = w \cdot x + b$ 
    from $\R ^d$ to $\R$
    where $d \in \mathbb{N} - \{ 0 \}$, $w$ and $x$  are vector in $\R^d$,  
    $\cdot$ 
    denotes the usual dot product of vector, and $b \in \R$ is a scalar.  
    
\end{definition}
