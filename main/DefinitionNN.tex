\chapter{Perceptron}

In order to simplify the Neural Networks' introduction, we are going to describe first 
what Perceptrons are. 

The perceptron algorithm for halfspaces.
 \footnote{A half-space is either of the two parts into which a hyperplane divides a affine space. } 


 First, basic definitions: 

 The class of affine function  $L_d$ is the defined as follows:

 $$L_d = \{ h_{w,d}: w \in \mathbb{R}^d, b \in \mathbb R\}$$
